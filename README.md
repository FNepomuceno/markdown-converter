MARKDOWN CONVERTER
------------------
by Francis Nepomuceno

## Overview
Markdown converter takes a markdown file and converts it to a pdf file

Python 3 is required to run the program

## How to run
There are two ways to run the program:

- `python3 main.py [filename] [input_directory] [output_directory]`
- `./main.py [filename] [input_directory] [output_directory]`

`[filename]` is the base file name. For example, if your input file is
`documents/text.txt`, then the filename is just `text.txt`

`[input_directory]` is the location of the input file. For example, if
your input file is `documents/text.txt`, then the input directory is
`documents/`

`[output_directory]` is the location of the output file. For example,
if you want to output the file in `documents/`, the output directory
is just `documents/`. The resulting file if the file name is `text.txt`
is `documents/text.pdf`

## Syntax(WIP)

### Headings
Headings are created by adding number signs(#) at the beginning of a
line, then a space before the word or phrase.
