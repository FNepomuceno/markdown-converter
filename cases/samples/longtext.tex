This is some text in a paragraph that is so long
that you need to put it in multiple lines to contain
it all. When would a piece of text be so long that
you need multiple lines to contain it all? Of course,
that is almost all the time. So when don't you need
multiple lines to contain all of a piece of text?
When the author cannot think of anything long enough
to require it.
